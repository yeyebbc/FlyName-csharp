# FlyName for Windows
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniacrespoa2/FlyName-csharp/master/appfilte_to_flyme_theme_icons/Res/designer_tools.png)

## What it does  
It is a tool for icon pack designers/developers to copy and rename the icons into `package_name.png` name format.  

## Why is it needed  
It is developed to be used when converting icon packs into OEM themes, where the icons are often linked to applications by file names instead of `appfilter.xml`.

### Before you use  
Due to my rubbish development skills, you should clean your appfilter.xml first, like cleaning duplicate lines, etc.
